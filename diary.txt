# day 1

## setting up
setup git repo
get erlang.mk
bootstrap and bootstrap-rel
rename to a less write intensive format

## basic design thoughts
use a simple_one_for_one sv to spawn 'games', interact on those pids to 'hide' the data behind

## ok, got for it!
do em_game_sup
supervisor setup assistance
why a seperate supervisor?
replace tabs from templates if you want

## design the gamefield state
in oop you would do a class for a field and a class to keep track of every field in the same game
but funcprog!, immutable data, what to do?
define requirements!
- fields should be easily accessible by coordinates
- anything else?

maybe we can use the coordinates as keys in our playfield so we can easily get / replace them if needed
short overview over datastructs in erlang
